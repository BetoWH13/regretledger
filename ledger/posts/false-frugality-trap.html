      <h1>The False Frugality Trap: When ‘Saving Money’ Makes You Spend More</h1>
      <p><em>“It was on sale, so I saved $40!”</em></p>

        <h2>The Discount Delusion</h2>
        <p>This is how the beast tricks you:</p>
        <p>You weren’t planning to buy it. You didn’t need it.  
        But now, because of a discount, you feel like <strong>you’re making a smart decision</strong>.</p>
        <p>It’s not frugality. It’s bait.</p>

        <h2>How the Trap Closes</h2>
        <p>The False Frugality Trap works by reframing spending as saving.</p>
        <p>Common lies we tell ourselves:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"It’s cheaper now than it will ever be."</li>
          <li>"I’ll need it eventually."</li>
          <li>"I’m actually being responsible by buying it now."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The result? Your money leaves faster than if you’d just paid full price for something you truly needed.</p>

        <h2>The Anti-Trap Reflex</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Ask this brutally honest question:</strong> Would I buy this at full price?</li>
          <li><strong>Reframe the “savings”:</strong> You're not saving $40—you’re spending $60.</li>
          <li><strong>Force the delay:</strong> No decision for 48 hours. If it vanishes? It wasn’t for you.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Real frugality is boring. Quiet. Invisible. It rarely comes with confetti.</p>
