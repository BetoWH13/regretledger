      <h1>When Confidence Became Expensive</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">Filed in the Ledger — Entry #3</p>

      <p>“I deserve this.”</p>

      <p>That phrase has emptied more wallets than bad investments and broken appliances combined.</p>

      <p>I thought I was rewarding myself. For hard work. For stress. For surviving life’s rough edges.</p>

      <p>It started small. A dinner here, a gadget there. I wasn’t spending recklessly—I was “celebrating milestones.” And soon, every Tuesday became a milestone. Every hard week deserved a reward. Every inconvenience earned a purchase.</p>

      <h2>The Entitlement Mirage</h2>
      <p>Here’s the catch:</p>
      <blockquote>
        When you start seeing spending as self-care, every expense feels justified—even the ones that bury you in debt.
      </blockquote>

      <p>It’s easy to confuse financial sabotage with self-love. Especially when every social feed tells you it’s okay to “treat yourself.”</p>

      <p>But here’s what those posts never show you:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The credit card bill that arrives later.</li>
        <li>The quiet shame of hiding transactions from your partner.</li>
        <li>The brutal realization that you’ve been your own worst enemy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ledger Lesson:</h2>
      <p>Self-care that creates debt isn’t care—it’s self-harm wearing a fancy outfit.</p>
