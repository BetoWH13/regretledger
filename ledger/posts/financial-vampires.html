      <h1>Financial Vampires: How People Close to You Quietly Drain Your Wallet</h1>
      <p><em>They don’t glow red in the moonlight. They don’t hiss. But they’re still sucking you dry.</em></p>

      <p>Some regrets hide in plain sight—disguised as generosity, loyalty, or even love. Meet the <strong>Financial Vampires</strong>: those people in your life who constantly (and quietly) drain your finances, often without you noticing until it's too late.</p>

      <h2>The Subtle Ways They Feed:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Endless "small" favors:</strong> "Can you cover lunch? I’ll get it next time." (Next time never comes.)</li>
        <li><strong>Habitual borrowing:</strong> They never seem to have their wallet handy.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional guilt trips:</strong> "I thought you supported me."</li>
        <li><strong>Group peer pressure:</strong> Friends who insist on splitting lavish expenses evenly—even when they ordered everything.</li>
        <li><strong>Codependent rescues:</strong> Covering rent, utilities, or bailouts for family members—again and again.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Regret Hurts Deeper:</h2>
      <p>This isn't just about money. It’s about boundaries. And the regret isn't just financial—it's <em>personal betrayal regret</em>. You question your own judgment, your self-worth, and even your relationships.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Turns out I wasn’t paying for their coffee—I was paying for their entire lifestyle, one Venmo at a time."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>The First Stake: Naming the Vampire</h2>
      <p>Who is it? A sibling? A roommate? That "fun" friend? Naming the vampire—even just privately—is step one. Your wallet won't heal until you admit who's biting it.</p>

      <h2>How to Escape (Without Drama… Usually):</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Set a Spending Freeze:</strong> No cash-outs, no covering, no exceptions for 30 days.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch to Equal Split Apps:</strong> Use apps where everyone pays their share upfront.</li>
        <li><strong>Polite Decline Scripts:</strong> "Hey, I’m on a strict budget this month—can’t swing extras."</li>
        <li><strong>Replace Guilt with Math:</strong> Track what these ‘small favors’ cost over 6 months. The number speaks louder than emotions.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The most important truth? <strong>Your worth is not measured by how much you're willing to financially rescue others.</strong></p>
