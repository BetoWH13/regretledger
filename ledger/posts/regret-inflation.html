      <h1>Regret Inflation: Why One Bad Purchase Always Leads to Another</h1>
      <p><em>“I already spent too much... what's another $50?”</em></p>

        <h2>The Spiral Nobody Warns You About</h2>
        <p>This isn't just a budgeting mistake—it's a psychological landslide.</p>
        <p><strong>Regret Inflation</strong> is what happens when one purchase blows your self-control to pieces… and instead of stopping, you go deeper.</p>
        <p>The logic? Twisted but familiar:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>"Damage is done, might as well enjoy the ride."</li>
          <li>"I'll fix this later—future me can deal with it."</li>
          <li>"More regret won’t even make a difference at this point."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>It’s Not About the Money (Yet)</h2>
        <p>Here’s the secret: Regret Inflation isn’t fueled by greed. It’s fueled by <strong>shame numbing</strong>.</p>
        <p>You're not chasing products. You’re chasing distraction from the regret you already triggered.</p>
        <p>The beast doesn’t care what you buy—it just wants you to keep going. Momentum is its favorite meal.</p>

        <h2>How to Disarm the Beast Mid-Spree</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Name it out loud:</strong> "This is Regret Inflation."</li>
          <li><strong>Physically disrupt the pattern:</strong> Stand up. Close your device. Go outside, even for 30 seconds.</li>
          <li><strong>Visualize the receipt pile:</strong> Imagine all the receipts from your spree dumped on your bed. Still worth it?</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> The longer you keep spending, the harder it is to stop. Momentum compounds—but so does control, if you cut it off early.</p>
