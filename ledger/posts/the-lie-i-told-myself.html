      <h1>The Lie I Told Myself</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">Filed in the Ledger — Entry #2</p>

      <p>“I’ll pay it off next month.”</p>

      <p>That was the lie. The quiet, seductive little sentence that has cost me more than I ever expected.</p>

      <p>Every time I swiped the card, I wasn’t just spending money. I was borrowing from my own future peace of mind. I was giving myself permission to ignore the numbers, because the ‘next month’ version of me would be responsible.</p>

      <p>The problem? That version of me never showed up. They were always running late, just one paycheck away from getting it together. Always promising, always postponing.</p>

      <p>This lie didn’t feel like a lie at the time. It felt like hope. It felt like flexibility. It felt like survival.</p>

      <p>But it was still a lie.</p>

      <h2>The Cost of False Confidence</h2>
      <p>Debt isn’t just numbers. It’s a story you tell yourself. And this one always starts the same way:</p>
      <blockquote>
        “I’ve got this under control.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>It’s funny how expensive those five words can get.</p>

      <p>Here’s the truth no one wants to admit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Next month” thinking creates next year problems.</li>
        <li>Optimism can sometimes be just another form of procrastination.</li>
        <li>Self-trust without accountability becomes a trap.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ledger Lesson:</h2>
      <p>Never trust a financial plan that starts with “next month.”</p>
