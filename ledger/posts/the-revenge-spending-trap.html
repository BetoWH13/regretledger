      <h1>The Revenge Spending Trap</h1>
      <p class="post-meta">Filed in the Ledger — Entry #6</p>

      <p>“Oh, they think I can’t afford this? Watch me.”</p>
      <p>“They dumped me? Guess who’s upgrading their entire wardrobe.”</p>
      <p>“Bad day? I deserve this.”</p>

      <h2>The Purchase Wasn’t About The Product</h2>
      <p>Revenge spending feels <em>powerful</em>. It’s a middle finger disguised as a receipt. A way to reclaim control after someone else made you feel small.</p>

      <blockquote>
        For five minutes, you’re the boss of the universe. Until the bill hits.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Why It Hits So Hard</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>It’s impulsive — driven by raw emotion, not logic.</li>
        <li>It usually exceeds your budget — that’s part of the point.</li>
        <li>It delivers an instant high — and an equally instant crash.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ledger Lesson:</h2>
      <p>Revenge spending isn’t about the thing. It’s about <strong>proving something</strong>. The secret? You can prove it without burning your wallet. Find cheaper ways to flex your defiance. Or better yet—let them wonder.</p>
