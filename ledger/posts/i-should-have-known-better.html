      <h1>The “I Should’ve Known Better” Spiral</h1>

      <p>It starts with a moment of silence after the checkout confirmation. You stare at the receipt—or the tracking email—and the cold realization hits:</p>
      <p><em>"I knew this wasn’t smart. And I did it anyway."</em></p>

      <h2>What Makes This Regret So Vicious?</h2>
      <p>This isn’t just about losing money. It’s about betraying yourself. You can't hide behind ignorance here. You <strong>knew</strong>. You anticipated regret before buying. That’s what makes this spiral one of the hardest to escape.</p>

      <h2>Common Signs You’re Caught In It:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pre-emptive guilt before purchasing, but still following through</li>
        <li>Replaying the decision repeatedly (“I even hesitated at checkout…")</li>
        <li>Anger not at the product, but at yourself</li>
        <li>Imagining others mocking your decision (even if no one knows about it)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The Hidden Truth:</h2>
      <p>This spiral isn’t about the money—or even the object. It’s about control. Specifically, the fear that you’ve permanently lost it.</p>

      <h2>The Counter-Move:</h2>
      <p>Instead of focusing on the lost cash, focus on the mechanism of override. Ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What convinced me to ignore my own inner warnings?</li>
        <li>Was it urgency, loneliness, pressure, or something else?</li>
        <li>What story did I tell myself to justify it?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The point isn’t to erase the regret—it’s to name its shape. Once it has a shape, it has less power.</p>

      <h2>Closing Thought:</h2>
      <p>Remember: The “I should’ve known better” spiral only thrives in secrecy. The moment you dissect it, it loses its bite. It’s not weakness. It’s just one of the beasts in your ledger.</p>
