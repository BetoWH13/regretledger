      <h1>The Sunk Cost Spiral: Why You Keep Throwing Good Money After Bad</h1>
      <p><em>“I’ve already spent this much… might as well finish it.”</em></p>

        <h2>The Fallacy You Can’t Escape</h2>
        <p>Humans hate waste. Your brain wants to “rescue” a bad decision by spending more to fix it.</p>
        <p>This is the <strong>Sunk Cost Fallacy</strong>—one of the oldest tricks in regret psychology.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Common Sunk Cost Scenarios</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Keeping subscriptions because you “already paid for them.”</li>
          <li>Throwing repairs at an old car you should have ditched long ago.</li>
          <li>Staying in courses, jobs, or relationships because you’ve already “invested too much.”</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Exit Plan</h2>
        <p>The brutal truth:</p>
        <blockquote>Your past money is gone. You’re only deciding whether to lose more.</blockquote>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Forget the past.</strong> Ask: “Would I spend on this <em>today</em> knowing what I know now?”</li>
          <li><strong>Cut mercilessly.</strong> Stop throwing money at problems disguised as solutions.</li>
          <li><strong>Document it.</strong> Keep a simple “Lost Cause List.” It helps stop future spirals.</li>
        </ol>
