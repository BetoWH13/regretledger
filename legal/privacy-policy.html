      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We do not collect or store your personal data.</p>

      <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
      <p>This website does not collect, store, or process personal information. There are no user accounts, no forms, no cookies, and no trackers here.</p>

      <h2>2. Browsing is Anonymous</h2>
      <p>Your visit to this site is anonymous. We have no way to identify you, and we don’t want to.</p>

      <h2>3. Analytics & Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We do not use Google Analytics, ad trackers, or social media embeds. This site exists to be simple, fast, and private by design.</p>

      <h2>4. Affiliate Links (If Applicable)</h2>
      <p>Some pages may contain affiliate links to third-party products or services. If you click one, you’ll be subject to their privacy policies—not ours. We don’t track these interactions.</p>

      <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>If this policy ever changes (unlikely, but weirder things have happened), we’ll update this page.</p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>
