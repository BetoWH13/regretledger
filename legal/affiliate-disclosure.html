      <h1>Affiliate Disclosure</h1>
      <p><strong>Let’s Keep It Clear:</strong> This site may occasionally include affiliate links to products or services. If you click and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission — at no extra cost to you.</p>

      <h2>1. No Influence Over Content</h2>
      <p>Any affiliate recommendation is made based on usefulness, curiosity, or irony — not because we’re paid to say nice things.</p>

      <h2>2. No Hidden Promotions</h2>
      <p>We do not hide affiliate links behind vague buttons or sneaky language. If a link is an affiliate one, it will be obvious or clearly labeled.</p>

      <h2>3. Why Affiliates?</h2>
      <p>Operating quirky projects like this isn’t free. Affiliate links are one of the few ways we keep the lights on — without ads, paywalls, or personal data collection.</p>

      <h2>4. Your Choice, Always</h2>
      <p>You’re never obligated to click anything. Your support (or lack thereof) is always respected.</p>
